# Project Title

Game Deck!!! is a desktop application to play all your favourite retro games using a single userid & password.

The motivation behind this project was the common frustration of installing all indivadual games that you love to play and creating seperated account for each game to keep track of your scores. And we all *hate* to do that.

Hence the solution to this was to create a application which combines all your games in one app and also be able to keep track of your scores all using a single userid & password.


## Game List

The games included are some of my favourites and the ones which i have played growing up & am sure most people of my age have as well. Hope you like them ☺

    1. Snake Game
    2. Quiz Game
    3. Pong Game
    4. Turtle Crossing Game
    5. Hangman

`*All the games included are single player games except Pong game.`
